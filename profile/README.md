It's never been easier to build a product. But getting found? That's still hard.

Early teams move fast—shipping features, talking to users, iterating on everything. But showing up consistently where your audience looks? That takes time most founders don't have.

Elevor automates the work of being discovered. We turn your brand's knowledge into search-ready content that publishes through GitHub—no hiring writers, no managing calendars.

### What Elevor does

- **Learns your brand** — analyzes your voice, audience, and positioning
- **Creates content that ranks** — articles optimized for real search demand
- **Ships through GitHub** — review and publish like you ship code

### Why we built this

We learned the hard way at a previous startup: building something great isn't enough. If no one knows you exist, it doesn't matter how good the product is.

Elevor is the teammate we wished we had—handling the repetitive work of content creation so early teams can focus on what actually matters: building the product and finding the next customers.
